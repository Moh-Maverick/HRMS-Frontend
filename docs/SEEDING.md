## Re-seeding Considerations

### When to Re-seed

- **Fresh Installation**: After initial setup
- **Data Corruption**: If data becomes inconsistent
- **Testing New Features**: To ensure clean test data
- **Demo Preparation**: Before important demonstrations

### Re-seeding Process

The seeding tool is **idempotent** - it can be run multiple times safely:

1. **Existing Data Check**: Tool checks for existing data
2. **Skip Existing**: Won't overwrite existing records
3. **Create Missing**: Only creates missing data
4. **Update Counts**: Updates department employee counts

### Data Preservation

- **User Accounts**: Existing user accounts are preserved
- **Custom Data**: Any manually created data is maintained
- **Settings**: Application settings are not affected

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Seeding Fails to Start

**Error**: "No existing users found"

**Solution**:
- Ensure Firebase connection is working
- Check that authentication is properly configured
- Verify Firestore rules allow writes

#### 2. Partial Seeding

**Error**: Seeding stops partway through

**Solution**:
- Check Firebase quota limits
- Verify API keys are valid
- Check network connectivity
- Review browser console for errors

#### 3. Data Inconsistency

**Error**: Department counts don't match user counts

**Solution**:
- Re-run the seeding tool
- The tool will update department counts
- Check for any manual data modifications

#### 4. Performance Issues

**Error**: Seeding takes too long

**Solution**:
- Check Firebase performance
- Ensure good network connection
- Consider running during off-peak hours
- Monitor Firebase console for errors

### Debugging Steps

1. **Check Browser Console**: Look for JavaScript errors
2. **Check Network Tab**: Verify API calls are successful
3. **Check Firebase Console**: Monitor database writes
4. **Check Backend Logs**: Look for server-side errors

## Best Practices

### Before Seeding

1. **Backup Data**: If you have important data, export it first
2. **Check Quotas**: Ensure Firebase quotas are sufficient
3. **Test Connection**: Verify all connections are working
4. **Clear Browser Cache**: Ensure fresh start

### During Seeding

1. **Don't Interrupt**: Let the process complete
2. **Monitor Progress**: Watch for any error messages
3. **Check Network**: Ensure stable internet connection
4. **Avoid Other Operations**: Don't perform other database operations

### After Seeding

1. **Verify Data**: Check all major sections
2. **Test Features**: Try key functionality
3. **Check Performance**: Ensure good response times
4. **Document Issues**: Note any problems for future reference

## Customization

### Modifying Seed Data

To customize the seed data, edit the seeding file:

```typescript
// File: src/app/tools/seed/page.tsx

// Modify departments
const departments = [
  { name: 'Your Department', head: 'Your Head' },
  // ... other departments
];

// Modify skills
const skills = [
  'Your Skill 1',
  'Your Skill 2',
  // ... other skills
];

// Modify data counts
const desired: Record<string, number> = { 
  'Your Department': 10, 
  // ... other counts
};
```

### Adding New Data Types

To add new data types:

1. **Create Collection**: Add new collection to Firestore
2. **Update Seeding Logic**: Add creation logic in seeding tool
3. **Update Verification**: Add verification steps
4. **Test Thoroughly**: Ensure new data works correctly

This seeding system provides a robust foundation for testing and demonstrating the FWC HRMS application with realistic, comprehensive data.
